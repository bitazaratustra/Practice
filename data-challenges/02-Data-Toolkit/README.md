# Data Toolkit

Welcome to the Data Toolkit module! ðŸ‘‹ Over the next three units we will cover the fundamental tools that any Data Scientist or Data Analyst uses on a daily basis.

## Data analysis

* Say "bye" to VS Code (for now), and "hello" to **Jupyter Notebook** - an IDE that allows you to add code, comments, visualisations and images *inline*, making it a great tool for data analysis and exploration
* Speed up your data operations thanks to **vectorized computations** and the **numpy** Python library
* Start learning the analytical and data manipulation capabilities of **pandas**, one of the most widely used Python data libraries

## Data Sourcing in Pandas

* Learn to utilize the **pandas** sourcing and parsing toolkit
* Work with a wide range of data sources like **CSV**, **API**, **SQL** and **Google BigQuery** databases and **web scraping**
* Extract patterns from text data using **regular expressions**

## Data Visualization

* Get to know **matplotlib**, the Python library for data visualisation that is the "ancestor" to many other Python plotting libraries
* Learn different types of plots and their use cases, from the basics like **line charts**, **bar charts** and **scatterplots**, all the way to **dynamic maps**, **ridgeline plots** and more
* Practice higher level Python visualisation libraries like **seaborn** and **plotly**, allowing you to plot more diverse charts, faster
