**ü•Å Discover Model Lifecycle Automation and Orchestration üéª**

In the previous unit, you implemented a full model lifecycle in the cloud:
1. Sourcing data from a data warehouse (Google BigQuery)
2. Launching a training task on a virtual machine (VM), including evaluating the model performance and making predictions
3. Storing the trained model in a bucket

The _WagonCab_ team is really happy with your work and assigns you to a new mission: **ensure the validity of the trained model over time.**

As you might imagine, the fare amount of a taxi ride tends to change over time with the economy, and the model could be accurate right now but obsolete in the future.

---

ü§Ø After a quick brainstorming session with your team, you come up with a plan:
1. Implement a process to monitor the performance of the `Production` model over time
2. Implement an automated workflow to:
    - Fetch fresh data
    - Preprocess the fresh data
    - Evaluate the performance of the `Production` model
    - Train a `Staging` model on the fresh data, _in parallel to the task above_
    - Compare `Production` vs `Staging` performance
    - Notify a human who will decide whether or not to deploy the `Staging` model to `Production`
3. Deploy this workflow and wait for fresh data to come

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup

Get your project ready for this new mission üöÄ

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>‚ùìInstructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

## Install Requirements

**üíª Install version `0.0.7` of the `taxifare` package with `make reinstall_package`**

Notice we've added 3 new packages: `mlflow`, `prefect` and  `psycopg2`

In addition, you need to install some binaries depending on your machine to make Prefect work smoothly: either [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) and/or [xdg-utils](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-utils/).

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>‚öôÔ∏è macOS</summary>

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>‚öôÔ∏è Ubuntu</summary>

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz xdg-utils
```

</details>

**‚úÖ Check your `taxifare` package version**

```bash
pip list | grep taxifare
# taxifare                  0.0.7
```

**üíª Do not forget to handle your `.env` file**

_copy_ the `.env.sample` file, _fill_ `.env`, _allow_ `direnv`


## Reset All Data Sources

Start your mission by refreshing all your data sources:
- CSV datasets
- BigQuery tables

We provide you with a command to download all the CSVs locally and generate all the tables in your data warehouse.

**üíª Run `make reset_sources_all`** (~300MB downloads)

**‚úÖ Check that both your `~/.lewagon/mlops/data` directory and your `taxifare_dataset` BigQuery dataset have been filled**

**üìù Edit the `.env` file to work with the `train_10k` and `val_10k` datasets, and set `CHUNK_SIZE=10000`** (let's start light)

üèÅ You are up and ready!
</details>


# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Monitoring with MLflow

- Use **MLflow** to store the trained models and the result of our experiments in the cloud
- Monitor the evolution of the performance of our models, experiment after experiment

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>‚ùìInstructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

[//]: # ( challenge tech stack: mlflow )

## Configure your Project for MLflow

### MLflow Server

> The **WagonCab** tech team put in production an **MLflow** server located at [https://mlflow.lewagon.ai](https://mlflow.lewagon.ai), you will use in to track your experiments and store your trained models.

### Environment Variables

üëÄ Look at your `.env` file and discover 3 new variables:
- `MODEL_TARGET`, which defines how the `taxifare` package should save the _outputs of the training_ (i.e. the trained _model_, the training _parameters_ and _metrics_) once the training is over. `MODEL_TARGET` can take 2 values: `local` or `mlflow`
- `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT`, which is the name of the experiment
- `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME`, which is the name of your model

**üìù Edit those variables inside the `.env` project configuration file as follows:**

- `MODEL_TARGET` with the corresponding value
- `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT` should contain `taxifare_experiment_<user.github_nickname>`
- `MLFLOW_MODEL_NAME` should contain `taxifare_<user.github_nickname>`

**üß™ Run the tests with `make test_mlflow_config`**

Now that your MLflow config is set up, you need to update your package so that the trained **model**, its **params** and its **performance metrics** are pushed to MLflow every time you run an new experiment, i.e. a new training.

## Push your Training Results to MLflow

### Step 1: Push the `params`

**‚ùìWhich module of your `taxifare` package is responsible for saving the training outputs?**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>Answer</summary>

It is the role of the `taxifare.ml_logic.registry` module to save the trained model, its parameters, and its performance metrics, all thanks to the `save_model()` function.

This function is called anytime the model is trained or evaluated.
</details>

**‚ùìWhat are the training parameters?**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>Answer</summary>

Have a look at the `taxifare.interface.main` module, the `train()` function sends a `dict` of parameters to the `save_model()` function:

```python
# main.py
def train():
    # [...]
    params = dict(
        # Model parameters
        learning_rate=learning_rate,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        model_version=get_model_version(), # üí° New method added for you, to log the model version from which to partial-train from
        # Package behavior
        context="train",
        chunk_size=CHUNK_SIZE,
        # Data
        training_set_size=DATASET_SIZE,
        val_set_size=VALIDATION_DATASET_SIZE,
        row_count=row_count,
        dataset_timestamp=get_dataset_timestamp(), # üí° New method added for you, to log the "date" of the train_dataset
    )

    # Save model
    save_model(model=model, params=params, metrics=dict(mae=val_mae))
```

</details>

**üíª Complete the first step of the `save_model` function in the `taxifare.ml_logic.registry` module**

```python
# registry.py
def save_model():
    # [...]
    # Retrieve MLflow env params
    # YOUR CODE HERE

    # Configure MLflow
    # YOUR CODE HERE

    if os.environ.get("MODEL_TARGET") == "mlflow":
        #[...]
        with mlflow.start_run():
            # STEP 1: push parameters to mlflow
            # YOUR CODE HERE

            # STEP 2: next question, keep empty
            # STEP 3: next question, keep empty
```



**üß™ Try to run the training using `make run_train`**

**‚úÖ Check on the [MLflow interface](https://mlflow.lewagon.ai) if your parameters have been pushed**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>üí° Hint </summary>
  Have a look at the [MLflow Python API documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/1.26.1/python_api/mlflow.html).

  Do not forget to set the tracking server with `mlflow.set_tracking_uri` and to provide an experiment name with `mlflow.set_experiment`.

  You should get something like this:

  <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/07-ML-OPS/mlflow_push_params.png" alt="mlflow_experiment"/>
</details>

### Step 2: Push the `metrics`

Let's now push the metric (MAE) to MLflow.

**üíª Complete the second step of the `save_model` function in the `taxifare.ml_logic.registry` module**
- Try to run the training again using `make run_train`
- Check that your metric has been pushed to MLflow

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'> üí° Hint </summary>
  You should get something like this:

  <img style="width: 100%;" src='https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/07-ML-OPS/mlflow_push_metric.png' alt='mlflow_push_metric'/>
</details>


### Step 3: Push the `model`

Now for the better part: MLflow allows us to store the trained model so that we can easily refer to it when we want to make a prediction. This will allow your colleagues to smoothly use the model you have trained!

**üíª Complete the third step of the `save_model` function in the `taxifare.ml_logic.registry` module**
- Have a look at the [MLflow Python API for Keras](https://mlflow.org/docs/1.26.1/python_api/mlflow.keras.html) and find a function to upload your trained model.
- Try to run a training using `make run_train`
- Check that your model has been pushed to MLflow

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'> üí° Hint </summary>

  <img style="width: 100%;" src='https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/07-ML-OPS/mlflow_push_model.png' alt='mlflow_push_model'/>

</details>


## Monitor Model Performance through `DATASET_SIZE`

You have a nice way to save your training outputs! Now is the time to train your model and monitor its performance. Let's start a set of experiments; increase the `DATASET_SIZE` and observe the effects of the increase on the validation MAE.

**üíª Launch some training runs, increasing the dataset size from 10K to 500K**
- Use the same size for both the training set and the validation set
- Use 1 or 2 chunks for dataset sizes <= 100K
- Use chunks of 100K for dataset sizes > 100K
- Use your local data source to speed up the process!


**üëÄ Inspect how your performance evolves when changing `DATASET_SIZE` on MLflow**

</details>


**üíª Put your _best_ model in `Production` stage in the MLflow UI**

## Make a Prediction from your Model Saved in MLflow

"What's the point of storing my model on MLflow", you say? Well, for starters, MLflow allows you to very easily handle the lifecycle stage of the model (_None_, _Staging_ or _Production_) to synchronize the information across the team. And more importantly, it allows any application to load a trained model at any given stage to make a prediction.

**üíª Complete the `load_model` function in the `taxifare.ml_logic.registry` module, then run a prediction using `make run_pred`**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'> üí° Hint </summary>

  Have a look at the [MLflow Python API for Keras](https://mlflow.org/docs/1.26.1/python_api/mlflow.keras.html) and find a function to retrieve your trained model.
</details>

üèÅ Congrats! Your `taxifare` package is now persisting every aspect of your experiments on **MLflow**, and you have a _production-ready_ model!

</details>


# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Re-train on Fresh Data

Leverage our workflow to re-train on fresh data üÜï

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>‚ùìInstructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

At present you are able to track the `taxifare` model's performance and choose which model version you want to set in `Production` for prediction purposes. That's good, but your mission is not over yet. You need to monitor model performance over **time** when **new data** is available so you can ensure the predictions remain **accurate**.

As such, here are the next steps you decide to work on:
- Simulate new incoming data
- Evaluate the `Production` model on new data
- Re-train on new data **only**

## Simulate the Passing of Time

> The _WagonCab_ Data Engineering Team gave you a nice input: you can get 100K new records per month, already chronologically split into two raw datasets: an 80K "train_new" and a 20K "val_new". As the previous trainings have shown you that this amount of data is enough to get very good model performance, let's trigger the workflow **every month**. But wait, you ain't got time to wait for it! You need to test your workflow right now! The good news is that the Data Engineering Team has just finished collecting and preparing the data from January and February:

**üëÄ Inspect the `get_new_data.py` file that was given to you by the engineering team**
- It is located in the root directory because it's not part of your TaxiFare package.

**üíª Try to download data for January**
- üí° You can run `python get_new_data.py -h` to get some help.
- ‚úÖ Check that you have the new CSVs locally and the new table in your data warehouse**

## Monitor the Performance Metric on New Data

Now that you fetched the new data, you need to check how the `Production` model's performance is evolving.

**üìù Edit the `.env` file so you will be able to work with the new data:**
```bash
DATASET_SIZE=new
VALIDATION_DATASET_SIZE=new
CHUNK_SIZE=100000 # In this challenge, we won't need multiple chunks as a "100K" new dataset is small enough
```

**üíª Evaluate the model performance on January data**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>Hints</summary>

You can use the `taxifare.interface.main` (ie. `make run_...` ) to:
1. Preprocess the new training set
2. Preprocess the new validation set
3. Evaluate the `Production` model's performance on new data (don't train it!)

Then you can check the MAE on MLflow.
</details>

**üíª Retrieve one more month of data (February), and evaluate its performance again**

You should start noticing that your Production model's performance decreases with time!

The MAE increase of about 15¬¢ is significant (we should cross-validate our model to be sure, but we don't have time for that in this challenge). It means that external conditions have changed such that the `Production` model is not fit for our purpose anymore. You need to re-train it with the new data to decide whether or not you need to deploy a new model.

## Update the `Production` Stage Model Weights

**üíª Re-train the `Production` model on new data with `make run_train`**

**üëÄ Compare the `Production` model's evaluation with the new model's MAE on MLflow**

**‚ùìWould you deploy the new model version to `Production`?**
<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>Answer</summary>

Yes! The validation MAE of your (incrementally) re-trained production model is better than that of your original production model. And this result has been evaluated on the very same validation set of 40,000 rows - a significant size that can be considered representative of the current February period. You should therefore deploy this new one to production!

</details>


**üíª Loop over the workflow one last time with the new data from March**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>‚ÑπÔ∏è Info</summary>

- You can start over on your "January --> June" journey at any moment with the `make delete_new_source` command
- You can very well call `get_new_month('mar')` without having called it with `jan` or `feb` before.
- These methods simply erase and replace what's inside `train_new.csv` and `val_new.csv` (and warehouse table equivalents)

</details>

üëâ You can even play with the MLflow interface to plot the performance metrics over time!
üëâ As the months pass by, are you as happy with your new model's performance as in January?


<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>üëç ML Eng Pro Tips </summary>

Why does my production performance deteriorate slightly, even after new incremental training?

1. As an ML Engineer who knows the best practices, you should **re-train** the model on the **entire new 100K dataset**, so that you can leverage all the info.
2. As an ML Engineer who understands Deep Learning, you should always try to **fine-tune** a model by playing with `batch_size`, `learning_rate` and `patience`, all of which are available to you in `taxifare.interface.main.train`. Indeed, incremental training (i.e. re-training an existing model on new data while keeping its existing weights) implies a trade-off between long and short-term memory models. Do you want to put more weights on NEW data, or on OLD data?

These two points are outside of this module's scope, but keep them in mind for your first interviews!

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Model Lifecycle with Prefect

- Automate your workflow with **Prefect**
- Keep a human in the loop ü§ì

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>‚ùìInstructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

> Good news! The WagonCab tech team tasked an intern with providing you with the **Prefect** boilerplate ü§©

## Workflow Package Structure

Here are the new files added by the intern:

``` bash
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ taxifare
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flow
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flow.py     # ‚ôªÔ∏è Workflow lifecycle code
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py     # üöÄ Workflow launcher
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_sources
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interface
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ml_logic
```

### `taxifare.flow.flow`
The trainee provided you with a full **Prefect** workflow boilerplate that they think will best allow you to plug the `taxifare` package and build a complete automation for its lifecycle.

### `taxifare.flow.main`
The intern provided an entry point, allowing you to trigger **ONE** run of the model lifecycle thanks to the `make run_workflow` command.

## Configure your Project for Prefect

‚ùì**What parameters do you need to interact with Prefect?**

**üìù Edit your `.env` project configuration file:**
- `PREFECT_FLOW_NAME` should follow the `taxifare_lifecycle_<user.github_nickname>` convention
- `PREFECT_LOG_LEVEL` should say `WARNING`(more info [here](https://docs.prefect.io/core/concepts/logging.html)).

**üß™ Run the tests with `make test_prefect_config`**

## Complete the Workflow

‚ùì**How do you complete the workflow?**

Our goal is to be able to run the workflow in an automated way.

We want our workflow to:
- Preprocess the new data
- Evaluate the performance of our current model in _Production_ (remember the MLflow stage?) on the new data
- Train the latest model in _Production_ on the new data an see how the performance changes

**üíª Complete the tasks and the `build_flow()` function within the `taxifare.flow.flow` module**

**‚úÖ Try to `make run_workflow`**

**üëÄ Inspect the MLflow UI to see your workflow logs**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong> üí° Hint </strong></summary>

  You do not need to write all the code right away before you test it: just put fake values in the return of the functions that you have not finished yet and observe what happens when you `make run_workflow`.
</details>

## Stay Tuned

> Congrats! The _WagonCab_ team is impressed with your automated workflow but wait, wait! The Product Manager notes that your workflow is missing **one last step**, don't you think? Exactly, you would like to be notified as soon as a workflow finishes. You know that  Prefect comes with a [couple of ways](https://docs-v1.prefect.io/api/latest/tasks/notifications.html) to do so. But the Product Manager would like you to use their own internal chat so the whole data team will be able to stay tuned.

**üíª Implement the `notify` task**

```python
# flow.py
import requests

@task
def notify(eval_mae, train_mae):
    base_url = 'https://wagon-chat.herokuapp.com'
    channel = '<user.github_nickname>' # Change to your batch number when ready

    url = f"{base_url}/{channel}/messages"

    author = '<user.github_nickname>'
    content = "Evaluation MAE: {} - New training MAE: {}".format(
        round(eval_mae, 2), round(train_mae, 2)
    )

    data = dict(author=author, content=content)
    response = requests.post(url, data=data)

    response.raise_for_status()
```

**üíª Update the `build_flow()` function then `make run_flow` again**

**‚úÖ Check your notification on [https://wagon-chat.herokuapp.com/<user.github_nickname>](https://wagon-chat.herokuapp.com/<user.github_nickname>)**

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>‚ÑπÔ∏è Wagon Chat API</summary>

The [Le Wagon Chat API](http://github.com/lewagon/wagon-chat-api) plays a role in the [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time) while students are learning to communicate with APIs and the fundamentals of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
</details>

## Leverage the Prefect Suite

Great, you now have a functional Prefect workflow that you can run locally when `PREFECT_BACKEND_SERVER` is set to `development`.

However, Prefect also comes with an online server + UI to play with!

1. Create an account on [Prefect Cloud](https://cloud.prefect.io/) and get an API key
2. Store your API key in a secret place üôä
3. Authenticate on Prefect using your API key (see lecture)
4. Launch a Prefect Agent (see lecture)
5. Switch the `PREFECT_BACKEND_SERVER` to `production`

‚òùÔ∏è In production mode, `make run_workflow` does not do any computation at all! It just sends a "snapshot" of your TaxiFare package to Prefect Cloud's web server (but does not execute it). Therefore, you will need to re-run this anytime you change your code or your `.env` locally.

**üíª Try to `make run_workflow` and check that your workflow has been pushed to your Prefect dashboard**

Now, because you have also launched a Prefect Agent that connects your local machine to the Prefect Cloud web server, you will be able to click on "Quick Run" on the Prefect Cloud UI to trigger the workflow locally on your machine, without resorting to your Terminal anymore. Think, for instance, that your local machine is a powerful remote server full of GPUs instead; you do not need to SSH-connect to it every time you want to launch a training !

<img style="width: 100%;" src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/07-ML-OPS/prefect_quick_run.png">

üëâ **Actually execute your workflow from the Prefect UI**
- üîé Find and run your workflow in the Prefect UI
- Check the performance of your model on MLflow

üëèüëèüëèüëè Congrats on plugging the `taxifare` package into a fully automated workflow lifecycle!

**üèÅ Have fun to finish with!**
1. Start again with data from January 2015
2. Execute your workflow with Prefect
3. Simulate the passing of time with the `get_new_data()` function
4. Follow the chat to check for notifications
5. Use the **Compare** feature of the MLflow UI to visualize the performance metric
6. Set the last best model to `Production` anytime with MLflow
7. Move forward by one month and repeat! You can even try to schedule your workflow to be run every 5 minutes instead of manually using "Quick Run" üìÜ

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Optionals

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>‚ùìInstructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

## OPTIONAL 1: Parallelization

1. Use the [`prefect.executors.LocalDaskExecutor`](https://docs-v1.prefect.io/core/tutorial/06-parallel-execution.html#scaling-out) in `flow.main.py` to parallelize the tasks
2. Launch the new workflow in `development` mode to test it, then go to `production` and visualize the effect on the execution time
3. Identify the existing tasks that can be split and parallelized
4. Create a `flow.parallelized_flow.py` based on the previous workflow and adapt it so the aforementioned identified tasks are split
5. Publish and run the new workflow and check the new execution time

## OPTIONAL 2: Model Fine-Tuning

1. Before deciding which model version to put in production, try a couple of hyperparameters during the training phase, by wisely testing (grid-searching?) various values for `batch_size`,  `learning_rate` and `patience`.
2. In addition, after fine-tuning and deciding on a model, try to re-train using the whole new dataset of each month, and not just the "train_new".
