Congratulation for your heavy lifting work with Olist!

After this bootcamp, you may want to keep practising to become Data Analyst.
In which case, we highly recommand you to keep practising your SQL skills 💪

**❓ Your challenge, should you accept it, it to re-do as much of the Olist module as possible, using ONLY SQL queries (and plots)!**

- To help you in this journey, start by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) then [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the following repository [https://github.com/lewagon-data/olist_full_sql](https://github.com/lewagon-data/olist_full_sql)
- It will help you create a local `postgreSQL` database containing one table per CSV, with primary & foreign keys
- Then, try to reproduce as much as you can from this olist challenge!

💡 Pro Tips 💡:
- Try to use notebooks so as to create "data stories", one query after another!
- We recommend you to use [ipython-sql](https://pypi.org/project/ipython-sql/) to execute SQL inside `ipython`! Results also be visualized with `matplotlib`.
- You can also use `psycopg2` to retrieve query results as `DataFrame`s, but resist temptation to use `pandas` for anything else than printing and plotting the `DataFrame`!


🏋️‍♀️ Good Luck 🏋️‍♀️
